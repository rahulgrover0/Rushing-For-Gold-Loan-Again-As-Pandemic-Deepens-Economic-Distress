People having small businesses or daily wage workers are facing livelihood threats due to the enforcement of strict lockdown in  most States. Nowadays the demand for gold loans is high, because unsecured loans like personal loans and group loans are not available because of the uncertainty prevailing all throughout the world. In the financial year 2020, the credit growth across this sector dropped massively due to the outbreak of covid-19 pandemic but the gold loans bucked the trend.</P>

After the special dispensation by Reserve Bank of India, the learning Institutions are only allowed to provide 90% of loan to value or LTV ratio, but this dispensation came to an end on March 31st. The LTV ratio is the sum of money that can be lent against the value of collateral deposited to the banks. 
The year 2020 has witnessed fall of gold prices from Rs 57000 per 10 grams to Rs 45000 in August. But at the end of March this year the gold rate showed progress and it stood at Rs 49000 per 10 grams. </P>
